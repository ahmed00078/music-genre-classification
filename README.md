# **Music Genre Classification**

ðŸŽµ **Music Genre Classification** is a machine learning project that classifies audio files into genres using two distinct models:  
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Based on extracted audio features (e.g., MFCCs).  
- **VGG19**: A deep learning model trained on spectrograms.  

The project is structured as a microservices-based application, leveraging Docker containers for seamless deployment and scalability.

---

## **Features**
- Upload audio files (WAV format) via a **Streamlit frontend**.
- Predict genres using:
  - **SVM Service**: Classifies based on extracted audio features.
  - **VGG19 Service**: Classifies using spectrograms processed by a VGG19 model.
- Confidence scores for predictions from both models.
- Visualization of audio waveforms in the frontend.

---

## **Project Architecture**
The application comprises three main Dockerized services:
1. **Frontend**: Built with **Streamlit** for user interaction.
2. **SVM Service**: Uses a pre-trained SVM model (via Flask) for genre classification.
3. **VGG19 Service**: Uses a pre-trained VGG19 deep learning model (via Flask) for genre classification.

### **Data Flow**
1. **User** uploads an audio file via the frontend.
2. The audio is encoded and sent to both the **SVM Service** and **VGG19 Service**.
3. Both services return the predicted genre and confidence scores to the frontend.
4. The frontend displays the results and visualizations.

## **Installation and Setup**

### **Prerequisites**
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.
- The following files must be present in `models_train/models`:

### **Steps to Run**
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/music-genre-classification.git
   cd music-genre-classification
   ```

2. **Ensure Model Files are in Place**
   Place the pre-trained models in `models_train/models/`.

3. **Build Docker Images**
   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

4. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

5. **Access the Application**
   Open your browser and navigate to:
   - **Frontend**: [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)

---

## **Usage**
1. Upload a WAV file via the frontend.
2. View the audio waveform and classification results.
3. Compare predictions from the **SVM** and **VGG19** models, including confidence scores.

## **Training the Models**
If you need to retrain the models:

1. **SVM Training**:
   - Run the training script:
     ```bash
     python models_train/train_svm.py
     ```

2. **VGG19 Training**:
   - Run the training script:
     ```bash
     python models_train/train.py
     ```

3. Place the updated models in `models_train/models/`.
